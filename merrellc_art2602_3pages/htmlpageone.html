    <h3 style="color:white; font-family:cursive; text-align: center;">My Digital Art Story</h3>
    <p style="color:white; font-family:cursive; text-align: center;">Amino was the first app that Ive ever uploaded my art to. I had a small community based off an animator that we all enjoyed. I made a lot of good friends on that app and I was able to learn a lot. Most of us were artists and we would collaborate and do art trades with each other. It was also the first place I was able to do full digital art projects. I was thirteen when I joined but a lot of people thought I was much older based off of how I acted and my art skill. That community was a great place to grow in skill because everyone would give tips on what you did good and how other things could be improved if you asked. My skill level wasnt great but when given that Id only been doing art for a few years, everyone seemed impressed.</p>
